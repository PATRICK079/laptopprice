# üíª Full-Cycle Machine Learning System: Laptop Price Prediction
This project represents a complete end-to-end machine learning lifecycle for a regression task ‚Äî from data ingestion and validation to model training, CI/CD automation, and cloud deployment. It goes beyond building a predictive model and demonstrates how to structure, scale, and operationalize machine learning in a real-world scenario.


# üöÄ Project Goal
To build a regression model that accurately estimates the price of a laptop based on structured features. This tool can be used by e-commerce platforms, retailers, or consumers for price analysis and recommendation.

# üîÑ Lifecycle Breakdown

**‚úÖ Phase 1: Data Pipeline & ETL Setup**
‚Ä¢ Designed a clean project structure with modular scripts and Git-based version control.

‚Ä¢ Connected to MongoDB Atlas for storing raw and processed datasets.

‚Ä¢ Built an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load laptop data into a cloud database.

**‚úÖ Phase 2:** Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
‚Ä¢ Created an ingestion pipeline to handle batch data input.

‚Ä¢ Applied standard data cleaning techniques.

‚Ä¢ Persisted training and testing splits for reuse across model versions.

**‚úÖ Phase 3 & 4: Data Validation & Transformation** 

‚Ä¢ Enforced schema consistency and performed data drift detection using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.

‚Ä¢ Built a custom preprocessing pipeline (feature scaling, encoding) using scikit-learn.

‚Ä¢ Stored transformed datasets as NumPy arrays for efficient downstream usage.

**‚úÖ Phase 5: Model Training & Evaluation**
‚Ä¢ Compared multiple regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost.

‚Ä¢ Performed hyperparameter tuning, evaluated using RMSE and R¬≤ Score.

‚Ä¢ Used MLflow and DagsHub for full experiment tracking.

‚Ä¢ Saved the final model and transformer as .pkl files for future use.

**‚úÖ Phase 6: Batch Prediction, CI/CD & API Deployment**
‚Ä¢ Designed a structured, automated model training pipeline.

‚Ä¢ Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

‚Ä¢ Stored model artifacts in AWS S3 and containerized APIs using Docker.

‚Ä¢ Deployed a FastAPI app on AWS EC2, supporting CSV file uploads for batch predictions.

‚Ä¢ Implemented robust logging and efficient response handling.
